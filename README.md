# Card-game-of-war
Classic game of war

War is a classic card game.  Here are some assumptions I made for this version.
1) If there is a war situation only one card is flipped face down and then the next one is fliped facing up.  Some variants of the game put three cards face down.
2) If a player runs out of cards during a war situation then he/she loses.

Game notes
1) To start the game click the "Shuffle" button.  Once that is done, then the Flip button becomes enabled
2) Flip removes the top card from each player's deck and places it on the table.  Then a decision is made as to the winner.
3) "See Cards in Hand" checkbox allows the viewing of each player's cards as the game progresses.
